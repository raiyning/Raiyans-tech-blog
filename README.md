# My Cloud Engineering Blog

Welcome to my Cloud Engineering blog! This repository contains the source code for my blog, which I built using Gatsby and deployed it on Netlify quickly and simply. I am to integrate/automate my obsidian notes to have a simple deploy for whatever I learn.

Please have a read on https://raiyans.netlify.app/

## Technologies Used

- **Gatsby**: Gatsby is a powerful framework for building fast and optimized websites using React.

- **React**: Gatsby uses React as its foundation, allowing for dynamic and responsive web pages.

- **Markdown**: I wrote my blog posts in Markdown, making it easy to create content.

- **Netlify**: Netlify is a cloud platform that allows for seamless deployment and hosting of websites and web applications.

## How It Works

1. **Gatsby Setup**: I set up my project with Gatsby by using the Gatsby CLI and selecting a starter template that suited my needs. Gatsby's ecosystem provides a wealth of plugins and themes for customizing the blog.

2. **Content Creation**: I wrote my blog posts in Markdown format. Gatsby uses plugins like `gatsby-transformer-remark` to parse Markdown files into HTML for rendering.

3. **Styling**: I applied styles to my blog using CSS, CSS-in-JS, or styled-components, depending on my preferences and project requirements.

4. **Deployment**: I chose Netlify for deploying my blog. Netlify provides continuous deployment, which means that whenever I push changes to my repository, my blog is automatically rebuilt and deployed.

5. **Domain Setup**: I set up a custom domain name for my blog using Netlify's custom domain feature. This gives my blog a professional and branded web address.

6. **CI/CD Pipeline**: I configured a CI/CD pipeline in Netlify to ensure that my blog is always up to date with the latest changes from my repository.
