Started blog today to search into the world of cloud computing first and connect some personal projects first. This is a place to document my steps foward.

Used quick boilerplate with gatsby because of the markdown features and hope to connect my obsidian notes for a cooler way for me update my blog in the future. gatsby quick setup and ease impressed me, I will explore more plugins and customizability and play around mroe with the graphql in here. 

Starting my journey with Virtual machines and bash scripting with the goal to understand cloud computing and devops later as I pick up skills

Yeah, I didn't either.
